# FoodWise-
The UI UX interface for a food processing website trying to solve the problem of food waste <br>
A survey by Electrolux on 4,000 households in eight Asia-Pacific countries suggested that Vietnam is the second largest producer of food waste in the region. Therefore, I and 4 other members of school worked together to find a solution for that. As a result, "WiseFood" was born. The target interface will have bright pastel colors and incorporate many creative food vector. I am trusted to build 2 functions: Sync calendar and Menu Package.This was the project that first led me to Figma, and it's still ongoing to this day.
